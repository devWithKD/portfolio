        Back in 2017, I embarked on a journey into the endless world of
        technology with a little project to build a microcontroller-based
        Battery Management System. It&apos;s funny how that small idea sparked a huge
        interest in programming and development, especially in IoT and
        microcontroller programming. That curiosity and enthusiasm have only
        grown since then.

        Nowadays, I&apos;m diving deep into React development and loving every moment
        of it. While my main focus is on crafting awesome React applications, I
        still enjoy tinkering with various tech projects and embracing my
        multidisciplinary roots. I&apos;m excited about where this journey will take
        me next!
